  <h1>I'm almost ready...</h1>
  <p>Ok, that all seems to check out, connecting me to the database enables me to think for myself, and remember what to show on your website.</p>
  <p>There are a few more things I need to check with you before I write my configuration file (a note to myself so I can remember how to read my database). Hopefully, the information I have worked out below is correct and you shouldn't need to worry about anything. But just to be sure, can you check the following settings are correct?</p>
 <form>
   <p>I believe that this is the folder I have been installed in, if it's not, could you please change it.</p>
   <input type="text" name="pathfolder" value="" />
   <p>This should be the folder containing the themes</p>
   <input type="text" name="themes" value="MP-Themes" />
   <p>And this should be the folder my common components are stored</p>
   <input type="text" name="common" value="MP-Common" />
   <button value="submit">Submit</button>
  </form>
 </body>
