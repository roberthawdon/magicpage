<h1>I'm sure I've been here before...</h1>
<p>Ok, I'm experiencing just a little déjà vu here. I remember being set up to run on your server before. If you're trying to connect me to a new server, or your database settings have changed, could you be so kind as to delete the <b>config.php</b> file from my working directory. This will make me forget the server I'm configured for, and allow you to introduce me to your server again.</p>
