  <title>Welcome to MagicPage - First Run Setup</title>
 </head>
 <body>
  <h1>Welcome to MagicPage</h1>
  <p>Congratulations, if you are seeing this page in your browser, then MagicPage has been installed sucessfully installed on this server.</p>
  <p>I just need a little be more information from you before your website is ready to manage.</p>
  <form>
   <p>Firstly, I need to know what server my database will be installed on. <i>(It's usually this one, just leave the default value if it is.)</i></p>
   <input type="text" name="dbhost" value="localhost" />
   <p>Great, now I need the username for the database application. <i>(Ask your hosting provider if you're unsure of this)</i></p>
   <input type="text" name="dbuser" value="" />
   <p>Ok, now I need the password for the database.</p>
   <input type="password" name="dbpassword" value="password" />
   <p>Now I need to know the name of the database I'm going to be looking up</p>
   <input type="text" name="dbdatabase" value="" />
   <p>Finally, some hosting providers only give their clients one database. To allow MagicPage to run alongside other applications, I can add prefix to each table to keep it seperate from other tables in the same database. <i>(Default value is usually fine here)</i></p>
   <input type="text" name="dbprefix" value="MP_" />
   <button value="submit">Submit</button>
